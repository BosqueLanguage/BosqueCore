# The Bosque Project

Bosque is a new approach to programming models, development tooling, and runtime design that is focused on supporting mechanization at scale and establishing a new standard for creating high-reliability software artifacts. The foundational design precepts for Bosque are:
1. Design for Tooling & Mechanization -- The entire system should be amenable to automated analysis and transformation. Avoid features or behaviors that inhibit analysis and automation.
2. WYSIWYG -- Humans and AI Agents understand and make assumptions about the semantics (behavior) of the code from the textual representation (syntax). Minimize the presence of implicit or syntactically hidden behaviors. 
3. Total Safety -- Don't just make mistakes hard to make, eliminate them entirely. Whenever possible rule-out entire categories of failures by construction.
4. Reliable Performance at Scale -- At scale eliminate worst-case performance behaviors will occur and will be very problematic. Design for low-variance executions and minimizing worst case behavior instead of optimizing for the best or average case. 
5. Failure is Always an Option -- Failure is inevitable and mitigation/recovery is a requirement for reliable and scalable systems. Give un-happy path processing first-class support in the language and ensure observability throughout the system.

# News
After extensive(!) experimentation and prototype work the project has reached a point where all the pieces are in place for a 1.0 release! We have 2 key components that bring new ways to deal with structured text processing ([BREX](https://github.com/BosqueLanguage/BREX)) and literal value representation ([BSQON](https://github.com/BosqueLanguage/BSQON)). We also have a solid baseline compiler and runtime for the compute part of the language. The 1.0 push will be to integrate, refine, and update the components into a state where we can self-host the next parts of the compiler and have a stable language for development in general. The 2.0 push will be to write, in Bosque, a full Small Model Verifier for the Bosque compiler!

There are no hard deadlines on this work but targeting a 1.0 this summer and a 2.0 by the start of the fall! Community involvement is welcome. There are some fidgity parts that I probably just need to manage but I have tried to open issues, and where possible, flag some that are amenable for outside help. This process will be taking place on `main` so, if you need to keep stability, I have created the `stable_pre1` branch. 

# Platform Road Map 
The current (approximate) roadmap for the Bosque project is broken down into a series of major components that are being developed in parallel + smaller but high-impact work items. These cover a range of complexity and required skills, from academic level publication results, through non-trivial software engineering lifts, and into smaller tasks that are good starter projects. If you are interested in one of these please find (or open) an issue for more detail.

## Current Work Items 
The current work items are focused on the 1.0 release of the Bosque language and it actively in-progress:
- Base Language design -- mostly workable (in the `assembly.ts` and `body.ts` files) with needs for documentations
- Core Libraries -- not much but lots of opportunity to build out from previous prototype code.
- Parser and Type-Checker -- partially complete with plenty of todos and needs for documentation/tests.
- Basic JS Runtime -- starting...
- Visual Studio Code Integration -- Just a simple syntax highlighter at the moment next steps are to build out a full LSP server.

## Planned Next Steps
The next steps are focused on the 2.0 release of the Bosque language are focused on fulfilling two major promises in the tooling and runtime space:
- Small Model Verifier -- a symbolic checker with guarantees of the decidability of the presence or absence of small inputs that trigger any runtime failure/assertion/pre/post/invariant condition.
- A Î©(n lg n) time and O(1) space runtime and AOT compiler -- a runtime that is designed to be performant, low memory, and predictable in its behavior.

## Inviting for Contributors
The Bosque project is actively inviting contributors as we move from a research focused into a practically focused project! We want to make this a a great place to learn and contribute to the next era in programming languages, compilers, and runtime systems. Below are some topics that are open for contributions and where help is greatly appreciated, we are happy to help mentor and guide you through the process.

### Breakout Features
These items are headline features that are large and complex(possibly open research) but will have major impact on the future of software development. They are great for someone, highly-motivated and skilled, looking to make a big impact on the project.

- O(1)-GC -- a garbage collector with constant memory overhead, constant work per allocation, constant collector pauses, and compaction! 
- Versioning and Packaging -- build a well-founded semantics for versioning + ability to verify if changes/version errors. For users the ability to confidently upgrade dependencies (also prep for package manager and testing features).
- Termination and Bounds analysis -- a static analysis that can prove the termination of a function/task/api and the bounds on the resources it consumes.
- Extend StringOf 
- API-Embodied Meta-Cognitive AI-Agent (AMC-AI) -- a big acronym but big potential! Take the idea of Bosque APIs, which are well suited for synthesis with generative AI, and combine with the verifier to have a _fully-grounded_ and API (tool) using agent that can reliably accomplish user tasks.

### High-Value Enhancements
These items are more defined in scope, and will make a big difference for the project, but still require a substantial level of technical skill and effort.

- LSP Server -- a full language server protocol server for Bosque that provides code completion, diagnostics, and other IDE features.
- API Manager and Broker -- to enable bundling and calling of APIs in a uniform and efficient method. Needs a bit of semantic work + OS and Cloud support.
- Testing framework -- both to run traditional unit-tests, examples, small-model verification, and fuzzing. Also doc-gen from code artifacts.
- Power-Proroguing -- take the idea [here](https://earlbarr.com/publications/prorogue.pdf) and use the capabilities of [BSQON](https://github.com/BosqueLanguage/BSQON/blob/main/docs/publications/bsqon_techreport.pdf) (full-fidelity literals and references) to make it practical -- also maybe have some fun with LLMs!


### Chunckable Work Items
These are well-defined items that can be done in a few hours to a maybe a couple weeks and don't require much (if any) special expertise. They are great for someone looking to get started with the project -- also see good-first-issues.

- Standard Library -- build out the standard library with a focus on the core data structures and algorithms that are needed for general programming tasks.
- Documentation -- write documentation for the language, libraries, and tools. This is a great way to learn the language and help others.
- Tests -- write tests for the language, libraries, and tools. This is a great way to learn the language and help others.
- Shell -- a Bosque shell that can be used standalone or for scripting. Mainly writing a host for tracking tasks and interacting with them + writing some tasks that implement basic shell functionality.
- TTD and Debugger -- time-travel-debugging is actually a pretty simple to implement feature in Bosque. Would be great to have this and a debugger that can use it! Might split this into deterministic replay & debugger as two tasks.

function flowit(x: Nat?): Nat {
    //ITest for none as special
    if(x)@none {
        return 0n;
    }

        //ITest allows binder for $x to value of x (with type inference)
        return $x + 10n;
    }
}

function restrict(x: Nat?): Nat {
    if(x)@@none {

# Installing the Bosque Language (Currently Development Only)

In order to install/build the project the following are needed:

- 64 bit Linux Operating System (Ubuntu 22 recommended)
- Version 20+ of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v20 or higher)
- Typescript (5.3 or higher) -- install with: `npm i typescript -g`
- Git and [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) setup

## Build & Test

```none
npm install && npm test
```
The Z3 theorem prover is provided as a binary dependency in the repo via git LFS. To ensure these are present you will need to have [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed, run `git lfs install` to setup the needed hooks, and pull. 

## Parser & Typechecker

Current work is on spinning up the Parser/Typechecker and some basic LSP support. Key design goals in these systems are simplicity and general efficiency. Fast turnaround times in the developer loop tools are a priority so all features are geared towards a max O(n log n) complexity -- no exponential blowups (or turing completeness) in the type system, a relatively efficient 2 pass parser, and a fast emit to JavaScript.

## Compiler & Runtime

Next open task on the roadmap is a JavaScript runtime and NPM package generator. This will be targeted as a fast turnaround for developer tasks and ease of implementation (+ nice features like supporting a web-playground or REPL). A secondary task is an optimized AOT compiler with the O(1)-GC and and a focus on fast startup, low memory usage, and predictable latency.

## Visual Studio Code Integration

This repository provides basic [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE support for the Bosque language (currently limited to syntax and brace highlighting). The installation requires manually copying the full `bosque-language-tools/` folder into your user `.vscode/extensions/` directory and restarting VSCode.
