%% This class will transfor a BSQAssembly in 2 ways
%% 1. It will convert all diamond flow operations into continuation trees
%% 2. It will work bottom up and track (1) which vars are live (2) rename on assignment (3) track if they are used as refs
%% 3. These 3 bits of info will allow us to generate the correct type of parameter for each continuation
